## ✨ Features

### 🔄 **Environment Switching**
Effortlessly switch between `.env.development`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production`, or any custom `.env.*` file with a single click.

### 📂 **Auto Detection & Sync**
Automatically scans your workspace for `.env` files and syncs seamlessly across multi-workspace setups.

### 🌿 **Git Branch Auto-Switching**
Automatically switch environments based on Git branch changes (develop → `.env.development`, staging → `.env.staging`, etc.)

### ✅ **Environment Validation**
Validate .env files for syntax errors, required variables, and type checking with custom regex patterns.

### 📄 **Diff View**
Compare environment files side-by-side before switching to preview changes and avoid surprises.

### 🛡️ **Git Commit Security**
Prevent committing sensitive data with pre-commit hooks that scan for secrets, validation errors, and block `.env` files.

### ☁️ **Cloud Sync Support**
Bidirectional cloud sync with Doppler Secrets Manager for team-based environment variable management.

### 💾 **Backup & Recovery**
Automatic backup creation before switching, with configurable backup paths and encryption options.

### 📊 **Status Bar Integration**
Real-time environment indicator in status bar showing current configuration, validation status, and cloud sync state.

### 🔍 **Secrets Guard** 🧠
Advanced secret detection powered by custom **Large Language Model (LLM)** for superior accuracy in identifying potential sensitive data exposure. Features:
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Custom transformer model trained specifically for secret patterns
- **Confidence Scoring**: High/Medium/Low confidence classification
- **Real-time Scanning**: Instant detection during file changes
- **Learning Capability**: Improves accuracy from user feedback
- **Fallback Protection**: Traditional entropy-based analysis when AI unavailable
