    "master": "production",
    "main": "production"
  },
  "autoSwitchOnBranchChange": true,
  "validation": {
    "requiredVariables": ["API_KEY", "DATABASE_URL"],
    "variableTypes": {
      "PORT": "number",
      "DEBUG": "boolean",

## ☁️ Cloud Sync Setup

### Doppler Integration

dotenvy supports bidirectional sync with [Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/) for team-based environment variable management.

#### Setup Steps:
1. **Create Doppler Account** and project at [doppler.com](https://www.doppler.com/)
2. **Generate Service Token** from Doppler dashboard
3. **Add to .dotenvy.json**:

```jsonc
{
  "cloudSync": {
    "provider": "doppler",
    "project": "your-project-name",
    "config": "development",
    "token": "dp.pt.your_token_here"
  }
}
```

#### Available Commands:
- **Pull from Cloud**: `dotenvy: Pull Environment from Cloud`
- **Push to Cloud**: `dotenvy: Push Environment to Cloud`

**Note**: Doppler tokens are stored securely using VS Code secrets storage.
